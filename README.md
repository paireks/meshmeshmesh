## Introduction

Open-source mesh processing library written in Rust programming language.

Mesh processing meaning: mesh in -> processing -> mesh out.

It could be useful for mesh modification, fixing, etc.

https://crates.io/crates/meshmeshmesh

Run the following command:

```text
cargo add meshmeshmesh
```
